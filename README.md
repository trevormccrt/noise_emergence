# Data

The data that comes with this paper can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tagEbX7_RdUgLQtR0kP6Eav3DKt8owwd/view?usp=share_link)

# Playing with my data

The notebooks in `analysis` give some examples of processing my experimental data. You can find code to generate plots like the ones in the paper here.

# Running your own experiments

The scrips in `task_runners` show you how to run a Boolean network evoltionary experiment using my [GPU-accelerated Boolean Network library](https://github.com/trevormccrt/gpuaffman_networks) .
