# Data

The data that comes with this paper can be downloaded 

# Playing with my data

The notebooks in `analysis` give some examples of processing my experimental data. You can find code to generate plots like the ones in the paper here.

# Running your own experiments

The scrips in `task_runners` show you how to run a Boolean network evoltionary experiment using my [GPU-accelerated Boolean Network library](https://github.com/trevormccrt/gpuaffman_networks) .
